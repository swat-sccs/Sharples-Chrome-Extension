Chrome Extension that displays a popup of Sharples' Menu
Written my Alex Le, Class of 2024

Thats it. That's literally all it does. 
It takes a JSON file from Swarthmore and nicely formats it
into a little popup chrome extension. You can find the 
extension here:
INSERT LINK HERE WHEN PUBLISHED

You can copy the code and use it as you want; I don't really
care. Credit me if you feel like it, don't credit me if you
don't feel like it.

You can access the JSON file that contains the dining hall
menu information at the link:

Things to add in the next versions:
 - Menus of the week/day after
 - Menu for Essie Maes
 - Fix the ::halal::, ::vegan::, and ::vegetarian:: tags
